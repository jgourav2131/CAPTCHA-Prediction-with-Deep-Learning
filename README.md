# HexaCAPTCHA Solver Design Documentation

This document outlines the development and implementation strategy for a HexaCAPTCHA solver. The solver is designed to process 500 Ã— 100 images, each containing a hexadecimal number, and return the parity (even or odd) of that number. The approach integrates computer vision techniques for preprocessing and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for character recognition.

## Methodology

### Stage 1: Image Preprocessing

#### Stray Line Removal
- **Process**: The initial step involves dilating and then eroding the image to eliminate stray lines while preserving the characters.
- **Result**: Characters are restored to a condition similar to their original state without stray lines.

#### Morphological Transformations
- **Process**: To emphasize character margins, a morphological kernel is applied, making the margins bold.
- **Outcome**: The transformed image highlights the character margins for easier segmentation.

#### Character Segmentation
- **Process**: The largest connected component, typically enclosing the characters, is identified and extracted using OpenCV's connected components function with 8-connectivity.
- **Outcome**: Characters are segmented for individual recognition.

#### Contour Processing
- **Process**: Contours and their hierarchy are obtained to remove random white splotches. The algorithm focuses on the highest level contours and approximates each contour to a suitable shape. Contours with a significant area difference are discarded.
- **Outcome**: Only relevant contours, representing characters, are retained.

#### Image Division and Segmentation
- **Process**: The image is divided into four parts based on the x-coordinates of white pixels, leading to the identification of segments for each character.
- **Outcome**: Segments are ready for individual processing and analysis.

### Stage 2: Character Recognition using CNN

#### Dataset Preparation
- **Process**: Segments representing the last character of the hexadecimal number are labeled based on their parity and used to create a training dataset for the CNN.
- **Outcome**: A labeled dataset for training the CNN model.

#### Neural Network Architecture
- **Implementation**: TensorFlow is used to build the CNN model, consisting of multiple Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers for feature extraction, followed by Dense layers for classification.
- **Hyperparameters and Training**: The model is trained using binary cross-entropy as the loss function. Hyperparameters were tuned through grid search to find the optimal settings for accuracy.

#### Model Performance
- **Size**: 7.5MB
- **Testing Time per Image**: 0.068 seconds
- **Test Loss**: 0.029
- **Test Accuracy**: 99.75%
- **Parity Score**: 1

## Conclusion

The HexaCAPTCHA solver demonstrates high accuracy in determining the parity of hexadecimal numbers in images. Through a combination of strategic image preprocessing and an efficiently trained CNN model, the system provides a reliable solution for CAPTCHA challenges. This methodology underscores the potential of integrating computer vision and deep learning techniques for solving complex pattern recognition tasks.
